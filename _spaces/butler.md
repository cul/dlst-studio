Studio at Butler offers space for between 25 and 40 participants in room 208B
of [Butler Library](https://library.columbia.edu/locations/butler.html). During
[Open Labs]({{ site.baseurl }}/open-lab.html), the space makes use of wheeled tables and whiteboards to create
small islands of collaborative activity. The room, with a tall vaulted ceiling, has ten separate tables that can be easily reconfigured.
