Studio at Butler offers space for between 25 and 40 participants in room 208B
of [Butler Library](https://library.columbia.edu/locations/butler.html). During
[Open Labs]({{ site.baseurl }}/open-lab), the space makes use of wheeled tables and whiteboards to create
small islands of collaborative activity. The room, with a tall vaulted ceiling, has ten separate tables that can be easily reconfigured.

Studio at Butler has no computers onsite, but it does have a large television
to which users can connect their laptops via HDMI. 

In addition to Studio programming, the room in Butler Library is also used as
a digital laboratory attached to a seminar or as a collaborative space for
regular, scheduled use. In Spring 2019, the space will be used by Professor
[Pamela Smith](https://history.columbia.edu/faculty/smith-pamela-h/),
Associate Professor [Dennis
Tenen](https://english.columbia.edu/people/profile/453), the [Center for
Spatial Research](http://c4sr.columbia.edu), and the [FAB-Musiconis
project](https://edblogs.columbia.edu/musiconis/) under
the direction of Professor [Susan
Boynton](https://music.columbia.edu/bios/susan-boynton).
