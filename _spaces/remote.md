During the COVID-19 pandemic, we missed the social life that we fostered around our collaborative research and learning, so we [started Studio Remote](/2020/10/13/studio-remote-launch/), a livestream where a librarian works on a digital project. Currently, librarian [Moacir P. de Sá Pereira](https://moacir.com) livestreams his show, “Coding with the Dead,” every Tuesday, 3–5pm New York time. Follow along live or watch the archive of streams on the [Studio’s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLOUh6s8E2FYAVAsJg3lgoA).
