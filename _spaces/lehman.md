Additionally, CUL Studio Lehman has six Dell Precision Tower 5810 PCs with 32GB
of RAM and 30-inch (2560x1600) monitors running Windows 10. The machines are
outfitted with a wide array of CUL Studio–supported software, including:

<div class="list-group mb-3">
{% assign apps = site.data.software | where: "lehman","true" %} 
{% for app in apps %}
<div class="list-group-item">
<p class="m-0"><a href="{{ app.url }}" target="_blank">{{ app.name }}</a>. {{ app.description }}</p>

The computers sit in three banks of two, facing a screen with a projector. A
cluster of movable tables creates a large, central table in the middle.
