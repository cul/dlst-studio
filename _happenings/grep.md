The graduate-driven, Group for Research in Empirical Practices in the Humanities is a working group devoted to workshopping, discussing, and reviewing recent work in progress that use computational, quantitative, or otherwise empirical methods in the humanities. We begin every meeting by workshopping a project presented by a member or guest, which we follow with a co-working session focusing on individual or collaborative projects.

We are excited by the prospects for empirical research in the humanities, but believe that novel computational techniques of cultural analysis can only yield significant results after careful application and sustained critical interrogation of the techniques themselves. We therefore prefer the plural “empiricisms” to the monolithic “empiricism” in an effort to recognize that empirical practices are just that: practices, each with their own affordances, limitations, and assumptions about what constitutes reliable knowledge. By discussing our own individual practices in this spirit, we hope to produce work that is both methodologically ambitious and rooted in strong critical reflection on those methodologies.

GREP meets weekly to share our work with each other, in this critical but informal spirit. If you share our enthusiasm, feel free to drop by to the Studio@Butler (208b Butler Library) to share your thoughts and comments and stay for our co-working session.
