### Introduction

#### What is the problem?

As the [Coronavirus
Pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic)
continues to spread around the world, the global shortage of personal
protective equipment (PPE) becomes more acute. With a 3D printer, however, it
is possible—while supplies last—for ordinary citizens to manufacture PPE and
make them available to hospitals and clinics in their communities.

#### How can I help?

Although 3D printers can be used to print complex PPE such as N95 masks,
printing a successful mask is beyond the reach of the abilities and budgets of
many people who wish to help. On the other hand, 3D printers are very useful
for printing visors that can be attached to clear plastic to make face
shields. This site provides documentation and the necessary model to 3D print
visors.

#### What will I need?

The face shield is made up of three parts:
    
1. An elastic headband holding the shield in place on the health care worker’s
   head.
2. A 3D-printed visor connecting the elastic to the transparent shield that
   rests on the health care worker’s forehead.
3. A transparent shield made of acetate or thin acrylic.
    
To create a face shield, one needs access to a 3D printer, cutting tools for
the shield itself, and the ability to sanitize the shields with disinfectants once they are produced.

### Printing

#### Raw materials

1. Filament (PLA, ABS). We used PLA filament from Verbatim, Dremel, and
   MakerBot.
2. Elastic sewing band, 1.5in (3.8cm) thick, cut to size, but around 16in (40.6cm). We used Dreamlover black elastic sewing bands.
3. Foam weatherstrip tape, .75in (1.9cm) wide and .5in (1.3cm) thick, cut to around 9.5in (24.1cm). We used YIJUHOU thick insulation foam / weather seal tape.
4. Mylar or acetate sheet, .005in (.13mm) thick, cut to 11in (27.9cm) x 8.5in (21.6cm) rectangles (US Letter). You can use mylar, acetate, PETG, or any other clear, impermeable material. We used Grafix DURA-LAR (P05DC0912).
5. Fast-bonding, instant glue.
6. Rubbing alcohol, bleach, or other disinfectants.
7. Zipper seal plastic storage bags.

#### Manufacturing equipment and tools

0. **Safety equipment. _Wear vinyl gloves and face mask while manufacturing and handling the face shield components_.**
1. **3D printer**. Any 3D printer can work, however, as long as it is compatible with the filaments listed above.
2. **Cutting tools**. Household scissors will suffice.
3. **Hole-Punch**. A typical office hole punch will suffice. The hole-punch needs to be able to punch through the transparent shield.

#### Files

1. [Tangible_Choksi_3_FaceShieldMarch21Mod.stl](/assets/files/Tangible_Choksi_3_FaceShieldMarch21Mod.stl) (by Madiha
   Choksi and Tangible Creative, based on the design provided by [Budmen Industries](http://budmen.com)).

#### Pre-printing instructions

  1. Disable Raft.
  2. Set first layer height to 0.3mm.
  4. Set infill to 10%.
  5. Set fill pattern to triangle.
  6. Set perimeter shells to 2.
  7. Set top solid layers to 2.
  8. Set bottom solid layers to 2.

#### Assembly instructions

1. _Wear vinyl gloves and a face mask while working_.
2. Print out the visor component on the 3D printer.
3. With scissors, cut the transparent material to a sheet of 11in (27.9cm) x
   8.5in (21.6cm). You can use a sheet of US letter as a guide, if your
   transparent material is too large. A4 paper may be too long for the
   professionals who will receive your shields.
4. With scissors, cut the elastic band to about 31in (79cm).
5. With scissors, cut the foam tape to 9.5in (24.1cm). Once the visor is
   printed, you can use it and the section marked F below as a guide.
6. Press a sheet of paper to the visor in place of the transparent shield to see where the centers of the four tabs (marked **T**) touch the paper. Mark those spots with a marker or pen. Keep the paper as a reference going forward.
7. Using the paper guide and a hole punch, punch holes in the transparent shield.
8. Remove the backing from the foam tape and apply fast-bonding, instant glue along the inside of the visor. Remove the backing from the tape and stick it to the visor at the section marked **F**.
9. Measure and cut a piece of elastic sewing band from the roll, 16in (40.6cm) long.
10. Thread one end of the elastic through the hole marked **A**. Tie it off. Thread the other end of the elastic through the hole marked **B**. Tie it off, as well. Readjust the knots to fit.
11. Snap the transparent shield onto the four tabs (marked **T**). 
12. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds prior to bagging the masks. Clean the masks. The brand of the particular material that we are using can be wet and wiped down. We used bleach spray. 
13. Once the masks are dry, bag them in the packaging. Hospitals will take their own precautions once they have received the items. Handle the masks carefully and keep them in a secure space free of crowds of people. 
14. Limit who touches the masks to the person making them and the person
    bagging them. They should not be passed between multiple hands.

#### Tips on obtaining equipment in collaboration with admins at universities/libraries

Many libraries and universities today usually have maker spaces and other
spaces with 3D printers. If you don’t own one, you may want to work with top administrators to get access to these printers. An email to the University Librarian, the Chair of Engineering, or even the Provost might get you access to otherwise locked buildings to retrieve the equipment. 

Remember that for the full protective shield, you will also need materials and
tools beyond just a 3D printer and filament. Another possible solution is to
reserve the spaces that have all the tools for this use by working with your
administrators. 

### Distribution

#### Finding clinics, practitioners who need the equipment

Many organizations are posting their immediate need for PPE to websites and stating specifically which PPEs are needed. They are accepting used goggles, cloth face masks and asking the public for face shields. A simple online search will help you target which organizations specifically requesting face shields. Invite medical professionals into your teams to allow for networking, to assess need and to help you navigate the healthcare world. 

Due to how overwhelming COVID-19 has been for organizations and health care professionals, they are centralizing how to donate on social media pages and are providing email addresses on how to donate. Some websites are stating that they will check the PPE for use as they come in. We do not believe specifically contacting procurement offices is necessary, and investigating where to donate is more important. [Here’s a sample list of places seeking donations in the United States](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1txEanDkIrJ5GNfSk-zlXkTlB-bQPNRN_Y69qEwmdme8/htmlview?sle=true#gid=1259409226).


As always, we recommend folks to exercise good judgement and caution when
trying to work with complicated, rapid responses to a crisis. We hope this
guide has been helpful, and wish all of us good luck during this pandemic. If
