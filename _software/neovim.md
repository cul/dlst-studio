Neovim is a continuation and extension of Vim, a text editor that is, itself,
an extension of [Vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi). Coming out of
a tradition of text editors that pre-exist contemporary word processors,
Neovim, like its ancestors, places the focus on _editing_ text, not just
writing or styling text. It can be extended to include a feature set comparable to any contemporary text editor, including many integrated development environments.
