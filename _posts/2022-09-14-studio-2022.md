Since the Studio’s [founding in 2013](https://library.columbia.edu/about/news/libraries/2013/2013-9-11_Studio_Butler_Opens.html),
it has always been committed to supporting emerging practices in pedagogy and digital scholarship. 
After over two years of effectively shuttered doors, we reopen them with new faces and a tweaked vision.

Studio co-founder Alex Gil left Columbia Libraries in July, 
and the Studio banner has fallen to Madiha Zahrah Choksi and Moacir P. de Sá Pereira to carry it forward. 
The Digital Learning and Emerging Technologies Specialist, 
[Madiha](https://madihaz.com) brings years of expertise in supporting innovative pedagogy with technology.
Additionally, she is a researcher of technology, law, and privacy, 
pursuing a PhD in Computing and Information Science at Cornell.
[Moacir](https://moacir.com) is the Research Data Librarian, 
where he supports researchers with data management and helps them implement adventurous digital scholarship. 
Having completed a PhD in English Language and Literature, 
Moacir maintains an interest in using computation and digital map making in the study of literature.

Madiha and Moacir are implementing a new rhythm for events on Fridays at Butler Library.
Studio will now alternate between structured programming on a specific topic and the famous Open Labs. 
The former will not be workshops per se, but, rather, opportunities to hack around a specific topic. 
A somewhat unpredictable show-and-tell for adults, 
the structured content contrasts with the laid back Open Labs,
where attendees can get involved, stay in touch, work on personal projects, learn new skills, 
share expertise, or simply share in the presence.

Additionally, there are new ways to stay in touch:

* [This website](https://studio.cul.columbia.edu) (perhaps not a new way!)
* [The Studio e-mail list](https://tinyurl.com/cul-studio-mailing-list)
* [The Studio public calendar](https://tinyurl.com/cul-studio-calendar) (most up-to-date info!)
* [Research Data Services workshops page](https://library.columbia.edu/services/research-data-services/events.html) (Studio events in context)
* [Studio YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLOUh6s8E2FYAVAsJg3lgoA/live)
