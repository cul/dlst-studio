With one semester under our belts, it’s safe to say that Studio is now back for real, 
and we’re excited to share our schedule for this semester with you all. 

Before we get to that, let’s take a moment and recall how our first semester back featured such exciting events as letting participants set up Raspberry Pis to use 
[Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/) to serve as network-wide ad-blockers. 
But surely, 
the highlight of the semester was when [Vicky Rampin](https://vicky.rampin.org/) visited from NYU.
She presented on various open-source qualitative data analysis tools, including 
[Taguette](http://taguette.org), which she is helping develop.

This semester, we’re advancing with both some old favorite topics for hacking and some new ones, 
including an April Field Trip to the Columbia Makerspace. 
Like last semester, we alternate structured programming (something a bit looser than a workshop) 
with Open Labs, 
where attendees can get involved, stay in touch, work on personal projects, learn new skills, 
share expertise, or simply share in the presence.

In addition to the regular ways to keep in touch, we're leading with a new one, 
our [Instagram account](https://instagram.com/columbialibdata) that we share with the Data Club.

And here is our calendar:

## February

### 3: [Introduction to JavaScript through Leaflet](https://events.columbia.edu/go/studio_js_with_leaflet)

We’ll be using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to build a simple webmap using 
[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com), an ubiquitous web-mapping library. 
Along the way, we’ll learn the foundations of JavaScript.

### 10: Open Lab

### 17: [JavaScript Is Not a Toy](https://events.columbia.edu/go/studio_js_is_not_a_toy)

Since its arrival almost twenty years ago, JavaScript has been considered a toy language. 
Here, we’ll be looking at [Observable Notebooks](https://observablehq.com) to see how JavaScript 
is redefining the space of possibility for doing experimental pedagogy and research with the web.

### 14: [Field Trip to CU Makerspace](https://events.columbia.edu/go/studio_makerspace_field_trip)

Time to take Studio on the road. For this week, 
we’ll be visiting our colleagues in experimentation at the 
[Columbia Engineering Makerspace](https://make.columbia.edu/). 
They’ll teach us about their 3d printers and more. 

**Note**: This event is open only to _current_ Columbia affiliates who have also undergone the Zoom-based Makerspace training.
The training is [offered several times a week](https://make.columbia.edu/hours-1) and takes half an hour. 
Alumni and people who have not completed the training will not be allowed in the space.

### 21: Open Lab

### 28: [Party](https://events.columbia.edu/go/studio_spring_party)

Oof. Another semester, another party with cookies and stuff. 
Let’s talk about what we’ve accomplished and plan for the Fall!
